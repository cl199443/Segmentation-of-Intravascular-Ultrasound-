# Segmentation-of-Intravascular-Ultrasound
This a project for solving segmentation of arterial wall boundaries from the IVUS images.The main reference paper is "EREL: EXTREMAL REGIONS OF EXTREMUM LEVELS"[1] in ICIP-2015, "Extremal Regions Detection Guided by Maxima of Gradient Magnitude"[2] in TIP-2015 and "Segmentation of Arterial Walls in Intravascular Ultrasound Cross-Sectional Images Using Extremal Region Selection"[3] in Ultrasonics-2018.

The experiment datasets about IVUS images can be found in http://www.cvc.uab.es/IVUSchallenge2011, where you need to write an email to the relating orgnization for source datasets. 

About the proget, I first try to code the EREL algorithm in erel.py and then to do the segmentation of arterial wall boundaries of IVUS images in connection.py and selectiopn.py.
